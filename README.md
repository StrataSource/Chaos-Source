# Strata Source Issue Tracker
This repository contains issues dedicated to Strata Source itself, which is the base engine for [Portal 2: Community Edition](https://github.com/StrataSource/Portal-2-Community-Edition) and [Momentum Mod](https://github.com/momentum-mod/game)

## Issue guidelines

Game-related issues should be reported on their respective repositories. Only submit issues here if their intent is to be shared between all partner games.

Issues should..
- be a _singular_ task that can be _completed_ independently
- include all necessary information to understand the meaning without having to ask
